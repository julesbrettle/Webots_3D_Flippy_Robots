If the argument `write_to_wbt` is set to `True` in the call to `make_flippys()`, a file called `flippy_sim_autogenerated.wbt` will be created in the `./worlds` directory of the project. Simply open up that file in Webots to visualize the swarm.

If `write_to_wobt` is set to `False`, a file called `flippys.txt` will be created in the `./script_outputs` directory of the project. The text in the file must be copied into the desired world file.
